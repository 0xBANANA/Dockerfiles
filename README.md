# Dockerfiles
Some handy dockerfiles. My dockerfile repos and projects of other people are included as submodules, so be sure to clone this repo recursively using the flags `--recursive -j8`.

All of my own Dockerfiles have an associated Makefile to build images and run containers. Just type `make` to check out the help output.
